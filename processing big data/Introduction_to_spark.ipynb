    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of MapReduce, Apache Hadoop radically transformed how data were processed at the time. However, one of the downsides of the MapReduce architecture was that Hadoop used the Hadoop File System to store data on disk while performing computations. Disks are typically slow and moving data to the central processing unit has a high cost, reducing the speed with which data can be processed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark went one step further in improving the processing of big data by introducing memory processing, using the **L**east **R**ecently **U**sed (LRU) algorithm and the machine's Random Access Memory (RAM). Processing data in memory removes the need to transfer data to disk and allows data to be consistently accessible by the central processing unit, greatly reducing latency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spark is built as a unified analytics engine, considering not just the simple use cases in ETL pipelines, but rather combining the following libraries:\n",
    "- SparkSQL, a powerful engine for performing transformations of Big Data;\n",
    "- MLlib, a machine learning library that makes use of Spark's powerful processing engine;\n",
    "- GraphX, a graphing library to process graphs at scale; and\n",
    "- Spark Streaming, an engine for performing real-time analytics on large datasets.\n",
    "This feature allows interoperability between the various engines and a uniform engine for the processing of various use cases in big data.\n",
    "\n"

    "## Spark characteristics\n",
    "*The developers of Spark have established some core principles by which they wanted to design and implement the tool. These characteristics are central to the Spark tool, and when diving deeper into the system, you should be able to easily see how they have been implemented.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speed\n",
    "1. Spark largely benefits from recent advances and a reduction in CPU and memory costs. Spark is optimised to take advantage of gigabytes of memory and multiple cores, and is built on Unix-based operating systems that allow for multithreading and parallel processing.\n",
    "2. Spark also builds its queries as directed acyclic graphs, which constructs efficient computational graphs that can be decomposed into tasks to be executed across multiple workers on a cluster. \n",
    "3. Spark's physical execution engine (Tungsten) uses whole-stage code generation to generate compact code for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ease of use\n",
    "While Spark is built on top of a simple logical data structure called a Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD), it offers high-level data abstractions on top of RDD such as DataFrames and Datasets. The abstractions provide a set of transformations and actions as operations to present a simple programming model to build big data applications in a familiar language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modularity\n",
    "Spark consists of various modules, including SparkSQL (the code module), Structured Streaming, MLlib, and GraphX. These modules are available in various programming languages (Scala, Python, Java, SQL, and R) with well-documented APIs. While being modular, Spark provides a single API for all modules that operate on the same underlying engine, allowing for unified processing for all workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensibility\n",
    "Spark decouples storage and computes (as opposed to Hadoop), focussing on fast, parallel computation. This allows Spark to read stored data from a very wide range of sources (Apache Hadoop, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, MongoDB, Apache Hive, RDBMSs, and more) and perform all the processing in memory. Spark's DataFrameReaders and DataFrameWriters can also be extended to work with cloud providers and streaming applications (for example, Amazon S3, Apache Kafka, and Azure Storage). Additionally, Spark has a vibrant community that has created connectors to other sources and monitoring tools.    \n",
